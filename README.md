#### Preliminary paper title: "Deferral to experts: Combining two modelling perspectives"

While the model of layperson-expert deferral introduced in Hein Duijf's 2021 *Should one trust experts?* offers a fruitful machinery for determining when such deferral is rational, it requires values inaccessible from the epistemic perspective that actual laypeople inhabit. Instead of using it as a direct
heuristic, then, I suggest employing it instead as a *"rationality benchmark”* for subjective reasoning accounts. Specifically, I propose (a prototype of) an agent based model in which laypeople deliberate trust in an advisor’s testimony via a Bayesian model from Stephan Hartmann's and Luc Bovens' 2004 *Bayesian Epistemology*, while their deferral choices are evaluated from the God’s eye perspective of Duijf’s model. As a very preliminary result, I deem these Bayesian agents quite rational for one specific task setup.
